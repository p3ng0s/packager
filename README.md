# packager
Get all of the repository and dependencies for p3ng0s and packages them for install

#IMPORTANT
basically this is broken i am rebuilding the distro from scratch and using a branch named v1 to do my work check archlive for more info

to build the local repository just run the setup.sh script:
```
$ ./setup.sh
```
